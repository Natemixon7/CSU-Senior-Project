### Problem Statement :bulb:  

Computers have many parts, and everyone uses their computer for different reasons. It's time-consuming having to browse 
through hundreds of different computers on multiple websites just to find the right one. Let alone the right one for the 
right price. You can never find a computer that has everything you need without making some sort of compromise. A computer
with everything you need is critical to doing your job and/or schoolwork efficiently.

Using an innovative website with artificial intelligence and web scraping, we can provide custom computers at an amazing
price without any compromises. With this website, we can allow customers to save both time and money while also ensuring
they get everything they need. Due to the high demand for custom computers, an innovative way to customize these computers
is crucial to cutting costs for consumers, saving time, and eliminating any compromises.

 ### Project Description :iphone:
 
 This project will consist of a website backed by a database that stores prices for computer parts scraped from the web.
 This database will update every 24 hours using a script so that the website's prices are always up to date. This website will 
 then implement its AI technology to recommend a custom computer and its price to the consumer based on a series of questions. 
 The consumer will then be able to switch out necessary parts to get the best and most affordable computer for them. 

### Proposed Implementation Language(s) :octocat:

Python, HTML, CSS, and MySQL

### Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in the proposed implementation languages(s) :wrench:

Beautiful Soup, Apache, and TensorFlow

### Additional Software/Equipment Needed :computer::joystick:

Computer

### Personal Motivation :cake:

As someone who loves building computers and has years of experience doing so, this project will allow me to communicate
and coordinate much more smoother with my clients. This project will allow me to focus more on creating a quality build for my
clients rather than adjusting prices and helping the client find the right computer for them. This project will do all of
that for me and I can use the time I save to reach even more clients. On top of all that, I will even gain some web scraping
and AI programming experience.

### Outline of Future Research Efforts :books::rocket:  

Moving forward I will first establish a reputable website that I can use to web scrape prices from. Once I have web scraping
capabilities, I will then establish a database to store these prices organized by parts. Then I will develop the theme and interface
of the website so that I can pull the prices from the database. Once this is complete, I will implement a script that updates the
prices every 24 hours. Finally, I will develop the AI that recommends certain builds based on a series of questions that users will
be prompted to answer upon going to the website.
